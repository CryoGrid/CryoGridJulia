# CryoGridJulia

This is CryoGrid (julia version). 

CryoGrid is a one-dimensional land surface model dedicated to simulate ground temperatures in permafrost environments. The model calculates the surface energy balance in order to represent energy transfer processes between the atmosphere and the ground. These processes include the radiation balance, the exchange of sensible heat, as well as evaporation, etc. 

This is the modular version, i.e. every stratigraphy is put together from different stratum elements (ground, vegetation, snow, etc.). For the basic structure of those strata elements and a short introduction see the short documentation.
